Key Features:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Utilizing the power of proximity-based classification, the KNN model offers an intuitive approach for diabetes prediction.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM, a powerful algorithm for both linear and nonlinear classification, is harnessed to effectively separate diabetic and non-diabetic cases.

Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB): The GNB model applies the principles of Bayes' theorem, making it suitable for probabilistic disease prediction tasks.

Logistic Regression (LR): Employing a logistic function, this model provides insights into the likelihood of diabetes onset.

Decision Tree (DT): Decision trees are used to represent decisions and their possible consequences, which are ideal for visually interpreting diabetes prediction factors.

Random Forest (RF): A robust ensemble of decision trees, the Random Forest model enhances prediction accuracy and minimizes overfitting.
